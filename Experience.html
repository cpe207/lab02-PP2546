        Experience
    </h1> 

    <p class="bio">
        I experienced difficulties trying to make friends. 
        <br> Maybe when I was younger, I was quiet and insecure.  
        <br> However, there must be a turning point for people where we all shift. 
        <br> I used to think it would be challenging to change it as soon as possible, 
        <br> but time flies through so quickly that I can't remember how long it took me. 
        <br> Therefore, I want to urge you to act quickly to improve yourself. 
        <br> Be sure!

        Avocation
    </h1> 

    <p class="bio">
        I am always looking for a quiet spot to relax when I have nothing to do.  
        <br> And observe a few people moving. 
        <br> Ang Kaew (CMU) is a place where I frequently go to heal my selfÂ after a long day of studying or stress.  
        <br> I endorse this location. 
        <br> You'll undoubtedly regain your life.
